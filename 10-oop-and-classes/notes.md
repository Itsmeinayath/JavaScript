# does javascript has classes
<!-- - No, JavaScript does not have classes. JavaScript is a prototype-based language. JavaScript uses prototypes where other languages use classes for inheritance. -->
# oops is a programming paradigm 
<!-- what is object oriented programming  -->
<!-- - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). -->

# why use oops 
<!-- - Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
    - OOP is faster and easier to execute
    - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    - OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time -->

<!-- parts of oops -->
<!-- - There are four major principles that make an language Object Oriented. These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance. -->
<!-- object literal -->
<!-- - An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). -->
<!-- protoypes -->
<!-- - JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning that objects can inherit properties directly from other objects. -->
<!-- classes -->
<!-- - A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method. -->
<!-- instances(new,this) -->
<!-- - The new keyword is used to create an instance of a class. By using the new keyword we can create multiple instances of a class. -->
