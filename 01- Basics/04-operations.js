let value = 3

console.log("1" + 2) // here it will produce 12 beacse "1" is string because its in the double quotes or single quote .the o/p adding two string 
console.log(1 + "2") // here it will produce 12 beacse "2" is string because its in the double quotes or single quote .the o/p adding two string 
console.log(1 + 2) // the o/p is 3 ,simple addition of 1 and 2 is 3
console.log("1" + "2") //here both are string so o/p is string the o/p is 12
console.log("1" + 2 + 2) //here also it acts as string 
console.log("1" + "2" + 2) // acts as string
console.log(1 + 2 + "2") // her it first adds the number i.e 1 * 2 i.e 3 and beacuse 2 is in double quotes now the is o/p is 32
